# Git Learning Lab

Welcome to IPA`s Git Learning Lab!

Here is the agenda that we are following for the Learning Lab:

*Learning Objective*: to become familiar with the value of git and GitHub for version control and peer review

*Motivation*: at IPA we are increasingly using Git for version control for research and data science projects, software development (e.g. Stata programs), and knowledge sharing (e.g. the Research and Data Science Knowledge Hub). 
We want to make sure that a wide set of colleagues are able to collaborate on these resources and know how to utilize Git and GitHub for version control and peer review.

## Preamble

* Git is a valuable tool for managing version control of source code (e.g. Stata, Python, R)
* GitHub is an online resource for managing source code (and in some cases deploying code to websites, databases, and other online/cloud infrastructure)
* The goal is for YOU to learn git, you don't need to become an expert
* Another goal is for US to be more collaborative in learning and sharing
* You will likely run into challenges. git is very valuable, but can be hard
    * Go through the materials, practice, practice, practice
* You are not alone
    * Be proactive in sharing what you learn
    * Ask questions
    * Help others answer their questions
    * Use Huddles, Google Meet, or Zoom to interact with colleagues. Or pair with a colleague in person...but remember to share out if you pair in person.

## Agenda
